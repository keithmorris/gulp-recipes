# Gulp Tasks in Separate Files

## Description

This recipe demonstrates a technique for putting your `gulp` tasks into separate files. This is a good way to modularize your gulp tasks and to reuse them on other projects. The tasks that run in this recipe don't really do anything other than echo some content to the console.

## Examples

### default task

`gulp`

This will run a series of gulp tasks which are included from separate files. This task itself is in the file `./gulp-lib/tasks/default.js`
